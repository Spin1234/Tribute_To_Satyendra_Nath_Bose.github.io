        Satyendra Nath Bose (1 January 1894 – 4 February 1974) was an Indian
        mathematician and physicist specializing in theoretical physics. He is
        best known for his work on quantum mechanics in the early 1920s, in
        developing the foundation for Bose–Einstein statistics and the theory of
        the Bose–Einstein condensate. A Fellow of the Royal Society, he was
        awarded India's second highest civilian award, the Padma Vibhushan, in
        1954 by the Government of India.The class of particles that obey Bose
        statistics, bosons, was named after Bose by Paul Dirac.

        <ul>
          <h2>Early life</h2>
          <li>
            Bose was born in Calcutta (now Kolkata), the eldest of seven
            children in a Bengali Kayastha[11] family. He was the only son, with
            six sisters after him. His ancestral home was in the village Bara
            Jagulia, in the district of Nadia, in the Bengal Presidency.
          </li>
          <li>
            His schooling began at the age of five, near his home. When his
            family moved to Goabagan, he was admitted into the New Indian
            School. In his final year of school, he was admitted into the Hindu
            School.
          </li>
          <li>
            He passed his entrance examination (matriculation) in 1909 and stood
            fifth in the order of merit. He then joined the intermediate science
            course at the Presidency College, Calcutta, where his teachers
            included Jagadish Chandra Bose, Sarada Prasanna Das, and Prafulla
            Chandra Ray.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bose received a Bachelor of Science in mixed mathematics from
            Presidency College, standing first in 1913. Then he joined Sir
            Ashutosh Mukherjee's newly formed Science College where he again
            stood first in the MSc mixed mathematics exam in 1915. His marks in
            the MSc examination created a new record in the annals of the
            University of Calcutta, which is yet to be surpassed.
          </li>
          <li>
            After completing his MSc, Bose joined the Science College, Calcutta
            University as a research scholar in 1916 and started his studies in
            the theory of relativity. It was an exciting era in the history of
            scientific progress. Quantum theory had just appeared on the horizon
            and significant results had started pouring in.
          </li>
          <li>
            As a polyglot, Bose was well versed in several languages such as
            Bengali, English, French, German and Sanskrit as well as the poetry
            of Lord Tennyson, Rabindranath Tagore and Kalidasa. He could play
            the esraj, an Indian instrument similar to a violin. He was
            actively involved in running night schools that came to be known as
            the Working Men's Institute.

          <h2>Research career</h2>
          <li style="list-style: none">
            Satyendra Nath Bose is revered as the great Indian theoretical
            physicist renowned for his work on quantum mechanics. His area of
            research was the theory of relativity. In 1924, he derived Planck's
            quantum radiation law in a paper without reference to classical
            physics.

          <h2>The God Particle</h2>
          <li style="list-style: none">
            As science unfolds the mysteries of the Universe, the accepted view
            today is that the Universe started with a gigantic explosion called
            the ‘Big Bang’. For fractions of a second after the Big Bang, the
            Universe consisted of the most elementary constituents of matter
            interacting with each other through other particles which are
            carriers of different kinds of forces existing in nature. And, the
            carriers of all forces in Nature are ‘bosons’ or the God Particle
            ‘Higgs-Boson’.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <h2>Bose–Einstein statistics</h2>
          <li style="list-style: none">
            Satyendra Nath Bose created this hypothesis in 1924  after realising
            that a group of identical and indistinguishable particles may be
            distributed in this fashion. Later, Albert Einstein and Bose worked
            together to expand the concept. A group of non-interacting,
            indistinguishable particles may occupy a set of available discrete
            energy states in thermodynamic equilibrium in one of two ways,
            according to Bose-Einstein statistics. The cohesive streaming of
            laser light and the frictionless creep of superfluid helium are both
            explained by the aggregation of particles in the same state, a
            property of particles following Bose-Einstein statistics. Only
            particles that are not constrained to single occupancy of the same
            state—i.e., particles that do not adhere to the Pauli exclusion
            principle restrictions—are subject to the Bose-Einstein statistics.
            Such particles are known as bosons particles because they have
            integer spin values. Paul Dirac first used the name boson to honour
            Satyendra Nath Bose’s contribution.

        <ul>
          <h2>Honours</h2>
          <li style="list-style: none">
            Bose was awarded Padma Vibhushan, one of the highest civilian awards
            in the country, by the Indian government in 1954 and five years
            later, was appointed as National Professor, the highest honour in
            India for scholars. He lived the remainder of his life in Kolkata,
            until his death in 1974.
          </li>

          <h2>Nobel Prize nomination</h2>
          <li style="list-style: none">
            Bose was nominated by K. Banerjee (1956), D.S. Kothari (1959), S.N.
            Bagchi (1962), and A.K. Dutta (1962) for the Nobel Prize in Physics,
            for his contribution to Bose–Einstein statistics and the unified
            field theory. Banerjee, head of the Physics Department, University
            of Allahabad, in a letter of 12 January 1956 wrote to the Nobel
            Committee as follows: "(1). He (Bose) made very outstanding
            contributions to physics by developing the statistics known after
            his name as Bose statistics. In recent years this statistics is
            found to be of profound importance in the classifications of
            fundamental particles and has contributed immensely to the
            development of nuclear physics. (2). During the period from 1953 to
            date, he has made a number of highly interesting contributions of
            far-reaching consequences on the subject of Einstein's Unitary Field
            Theory." Bose's work was evaluated by an expert of the Nobel
            Committee, Oskar Klein, who deemed his work worthy of a Nobel
            Prize.
